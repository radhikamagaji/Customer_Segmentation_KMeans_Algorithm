# Customer_Segmentation_KMeans_Algorithm

## About Project:
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a customers based on common characteristics such as demographics or behavior. In this project, I performed customer segmentation on a dataset containing customer demographics and transactions data from an Indian bank. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle.

Dataset:
This dataset consists of 1 Million+ transactions by over 800K customers for a bank in India. The data includes information such as customer age (DOB), location, gender, account balance at the time of the transaction, transaction details, transaction amount, etc.

Objective:
Perform customer segmentation using K-Means algorithm and identify clusters of customers. This allows the bank to better understand their customers spending behaviours and hence tailor their offerings according to customers' preferences, ultimately leading to better services boosting the business.

Steps performed:
1. Data collection
2. Data cleaning
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Model Selection: Clustering Algorithms
5. Model Evaluation
6. Conclusion

Conclusion:
Cluster 4 consists of customers with average age "33+" their activity on transaction amount and account balance is typically lower, which makes this cluster a potential target for engagement and marketing strategies to increase their transaction involvement.
Cluster 2 consists of customers with average age of "54+", their bank balances are typically higher as is their transaction activity as compared to other clusters.
It is interesting to note that after the ages of 54, the average account balance and transcation activity lowers. This is reflected in the cluster 1 which represents the average age group of "64+".
By applying tailored marketing campaigns, customer interaction and engagement can be improved and the bank can make better returns on the investments.
